# EIRA Library of Interoperability Specifications (ELIS)

## ELIS repository
The ELIS repository has been set up for the public distribution of the EIRA Library of Interoperability Specifications (ELIS). 

The ELIS provides a set of interoperability specifications that define the interoperability requirements of the Architecture Building Blocks (ABBs) contained in the European Interoperability Reference Architecture (EIRA). 

ELIS is expressed as an electronic catalogue so it can be consumed by software applications like ArchiÂ® and other architecture modelling and development tools. For its expression as a machine-readable artefact, the ELIS uses the DCAT-AP specification.
